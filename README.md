#Uptown Shopper

This is the client code for a shopping list app, intended for use by my family. The aim
is to simplify our grocery list and shopping efforts, and to include features that empower us in our
weekly shopping chores and make the process as easy as possible. I don't know if this app will be useful to anyone else, 
yet, but I do plan to make it available for download when it is "finished".

This app serves two purposes: I want to build a better shopping list, but I will also use the app as a proving 
ground for my learnings and experiments. So, as soon as I finish the client code in Angular 6, I will immediately 
rebuild it in React, so as to continue the learning process. 

**Current Status**

This app is a work in progress, though the client code is mostly finished. Once the app is deployed, I will circle back and add a full suite of tests using the appropriate libraries.


**Getting Started**

Coming soon!


**Built With**

Angular 6, .NET Core, PostgreSQL
